\section{Prerequisites}\label{sec:prep}
The Feat\_FloWer software package is accessible through the version control system \textit{Git}. The main repository of the software is hosted on the servers of the TU Dortmund.
In order to checkout a copy of the code an account that provides access to the LS3 servers is required, so it is recommended to get such an account. Furthermore, the code repository does not include the meshes used in the example applications. The meshes are stored in a different repository. So, at first we will get this repository and set up
an environment variable so that the configuration mechanism of Feat\_FloWer can find the mesh repository. The mesh repo can be checked out by: \\
\cmd{git clone ssh://username@lannister/home/user/git/mesh\_repo.git}\\
If the above command does not complete successfully it is very likely that you do not yet have access rights to the git mesh repository. In this case please ask your administrator to grant you
the required access rights.
After you have checked out the mesh repository, it is time to set up the environment variable for Feat\_FloWer. For the \texttt{BASH} or \texttt{ZSH} shells this can be done by
adding the following line to your \textit{.bashrc} or respectively \textit{.zsh}:\\
\cmd{export Q2P1\_MESH\_DIR=/path/to/meshrepo/mesh\_repo}\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Checking out the Code from the Repository}\label{bar}
 When you have acquired an appropriate account you can clone the Feat\_FloWer repository by opening a terminal and entering the following sequence of commands:\\
\cmd{mkdir FeatFlower \&\& cd FeatFlower}\\
\cmd{git clone {-{}-}recursive ssh://username@lannister/home/user/git/Feat\_FloWer.git}\\
This will create a parent folder called FeatFlower and within this folder the source code will be contained. This is a preparation for building the code from source. The Feat\_Flower code supports only out-of-source builds, meaning the binary files are not built in the same directory as the source code. This is done in order to prevent that binary files or object files litter the source directory or that these files show up in the version control system.

\section{Building the Code from Source}\label{baz}
The Feat\_FloWer code can be build on Linux and Windows operating systems (and probably on MacOS, but this is not tested yet). On Linux systems an installation of the GNU compiler is needed, including the gfortran compiler and the matching OpenMPI libraries. The minimum requirement for the GCC is version 4.9.2. On Linux systems the Intel compiler can be used as an alternative compiler. On Windows systems the Intel compiler is a necessary requirement.
\subsection{Linux Systems}
After you have cloned the repository, navigate to the \textit{FeatFlower} folder that you have created in the previous step and create another folder that will contain the binaries:\\
\cmd{mkdir bin}\\
Verify with the command \textbf{pwd} that your FeatFlower folder now contains two subfolders \textit{bin} and \textit{Feat\_FloWer}. At the core of the Feat\_FloWer build system
is the multi-platform build files generator CMake. On the servers of the TU Dortmund CMake is available as a loadable module. In order to successfully compile the code with the GNU compiler the following components are needed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item GCC the GNU Compiler Collection including the gfortran compiler
	\item A matching OpenMPI installation
	\item CMake with a minimum version of 2.8
\end{itemize}
On the servers of the TU Dortmund load for example the following modules or newer versions of them:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cmd{module load gcc/6.1.0}
  \item \cmd{module load openmpi/gcc6.1.x/1.10.2/non-threaded/no-cuda/ethernet}
  \item \cmd{module load cmake/3.5.2-ssl}	
\end{itemize}

In order for CMake to use the compiler that has been added by the module system it is recommended to set the environment variables \texttt{CC}, \texttt{CXX}, \texttt{FC} accordingly. In detail this
this means executing the commands (for \texttt{BASH} or \texttt{ZSH} shells):

\begin{itemize}
  \item \cmd{export CC=\$(which mpicc)}
  \item \cmd{export CXX=\$(which mpicxx)}
  \item \cmd{export FC=\$(which mpif90)}
\end{itemize}
for the \texttt{TCSH} or \texttt{CSH} shells use the syntax:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cmd{setenv CC mpicc}
  \item \cmd{setenv CXX mpicxx}
  \item \cmd{setenv FC mpif90}
\end{itemize}
It is advised to create shell aliases for these commands because they are used frequently. After you have entered the load commands, verify that these module are loaded by checking the output of the command \textbf{module list}. The build of the basic software package is
initiated by navigating into the \textit{bin} folder that you have created before and evoking CMake from there:\\
\cmd{cd bin}\\
\cmd{cmake -DBUILD\_METIS=True ../Feat\_FloWer}\\
The build process is then started by the command:\\
\cmd{make -j 5}\\
The option <-j 5> starts a parallel build using 5 processes.

\chapter{Running a FeatFlower Application}
\label{ch:applications}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction to the Application Framework}\label{sec:introduction}
A FeatFlower application is a particular simulation case that is based on the underlying Finite-Element-Method framework. The possibility of a FeatFloWer application range from very simple CFD-Setups to well-known benchmark
configurations to complex realistic configurations that have an industrial or scientific background. The FeatFlower code base comes with a number of preconfigured applications that demonstrate the capabilities of the software. The
user can then change and adapt these preconfigured applications to his needs or add completely new applications based on the Featflower framework. A FeatFloWer applications roughly consists of a preprocessing step, a solving procedure and an output of the solution. At first we will introduce the tools used in the preprocessing step. 
\subsection{Preprocessing and Mesh Generation}
The main task in the preprocessing step is the creation of the mesh used for the FeatFloWer application. A mesh can be acquired by an external mesh generator, by manual construction or by taking a mesh from the FeatFloWer mesh
repository.  
\subsubsection{Using Meshes from the Mesh Repository}
Taking a mesh from the mesh repository is the easiest scenario for a new user. Usually this means that a benchmark configuration or a preconfigured application is run by the user. All the user has to do in this case is to 
partition the mesh according to the number of MPI processes that the user has to his disposal. The preferred partitioning tool for meshes from the mesh repository is the Python command line program \textit{PyPartitioner.py}. In order to demonstrate the use of the python partitioning tool, we will use the application \textit{q2p1\_fc\_ext}. The application can be found in the \textit{Feat\_FloWer/applications} directory. The python partitioner tool can be 
found in the \textit{Feat\_FloWer/tools} directory. For our first contact with the tool, we will just copy the python files from the \textit{Feat\_FloWer/tools} directory to the \textit{bin/applications/q2p1\_fc\_ext}. So start by navigating to the \textit{bin/applications/q2p1\_fc\_ext} and copying the python files by:\\
\cmd{cp ../../../Feat\_FloWer/tools/*.py .}\\
Additionally, we need to copy the metis library so that the PyPartitioner can interface with that library:\\
\cmd{cp ../../../bin/extern/libraries/metis-4.0.3/Lib/libmetis.so .}\\
We can now invoke the PyPartitioner by typing:\\
\cmd{python PyPartitioner.py 4 1 1 NEWFAC \_adc/2D\_FAC/2Dbench.prj}\\
which will take the mesh referenced in the project file \textit{\_adc/2D\_FAC/2Dbench.prj} and decompose the domain into 4 partitions which are then stored in the \textit{NEWFAC} directory. The additional 1 1 parameters denote the
type of the partitioning method. As the simulation requires a master node to control some processes the simulation should be launched with 4+1 processes by:\\
\cmd{mpirun -np 5 ./q2p1\_fc\_ext}\\

\subsection{Recommended Shell Customizations For Linux Systems}
In order to work more efficiently with the FeatFloWer software, we recommended to add some environment variables and aliases 
to your shell configuration files in order to make your experience with the software more pleasant. Sample configuration files are provided in the FeatFloWe repository you have cloned in the
first steps. The configuration files can be found in the repository under the following path:
\cmd{/path/to/Feat\_FloWer/tools/shell\_scripts}\\
There sample configuration for different shells can be found. As can be seen in the following listings, the configuration files contain aliases for loading compiler settings, customizations for 
the command line for the Git version control system and setting environment variables so that the different FeatFloWer auxilliary scripts are contained in the path and can be easily called from the
command line.
