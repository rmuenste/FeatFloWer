    "Where $F$ is the magnitude of the stretching force, $\\Delta x$ the corresponding elongation of the spring from equilibrium, and $k$ is a constact that depends on the geometry and the material of the spring. If the deformations are small enough, most materials, in fact, behave like springs: Their deformation is directly proportional to the external force. Therefore, it may be useful to operate with an expression that is similar to Hooke's law but describes the properties of various materials, as opposed to objects such as springs. Such an expression does exist. Consider, for instance, a bar of initial length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$ stressed by a force of magnitude $F$. As a result, the bar stretches by $\\Delta L$."
